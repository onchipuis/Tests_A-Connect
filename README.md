***
All the files needed to develop a library for easy deployment of A-Connect.


## General Info
### Algorithm description
A-Connect is a methodology that provides to the users a statistical way to train their neural networks. One of the A-Connect advantages
is the mismatch mitigation due to the stochastic variations. This methodology also allows the binarization of the layer weights to reduce 
the memory footprint of the layer.
