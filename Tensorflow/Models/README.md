## General Info
This folder contains 4 trained models in format hd5 (custom format provided by keras to save trained models). The model architecure is shown below.
![DNN_Architecure](./DNN_Architecure.jpg)
We have all the models saved(model architecture, weights, and optimizer) and also we have only the model weights saved.
1. [AConnect full model](aconnect_network.h5)
2. [AConnect weights](aconnect_nn_weights.h5)
3. [DropConnect full model](dropconnect_network.h5)
4. [DropConnect weights](dropconnect_nn_weights.h5)
5. [Dropout full model](dropout_network.h5)
6. [Dropout weights](dropout_nn_weights.h5)
7. [No regularizations full model](no_reg_network.h5)
8. [NO regularizations weights](noreg_nn_weights.h5)
