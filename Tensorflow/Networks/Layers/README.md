# Layers
***

## General Info
This folder contains the following custom layers:
1. [A-Connect FC Layer](AConnect.py): Custom layer with A-Connect for a fully-connected layer.
2. [DropConnect FC Layer](DropConnect.py): Custom layer with Dropconnect with weights mimatch. 
3. [Custom Dropout Layer](DropLayer.py): Custom layer with custom dropout.
4. [FC layer with weights binarization](FC_quant.py): Custom fully-connected layer with quantized weights.(Is not tested yet)
5. [Custom FC layer](fullyconnected.py): Custom fully-connected layer.
6. [Custom Conv2D layer](Conv.py): Custom convolutional 2D layer.
7. [Convolutional A-Connect layer](ConvAConnect.py): First approach to an A-Connect convolutional layer. Actually needs a GPU to train a simple network. It takes around 40 minutes per epoch.
